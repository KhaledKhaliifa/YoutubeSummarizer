 So I'm someone who doesn't have a lot of friends. Like I don't have like a lot of social relationships. I have a couple of friends here and there that I talk to occasionally, but I don't have any consistent IRL social relationships and most of my friends are online and even then we don't really talk very often. I don't have like friends that I hang out with online every day or frequently. Right. And I just thought I would talk about like what what like social isolation at this level is like because I think it's an interesting perspective because I don't think a lot of people have this perspective. Maybe there are a lot of people and I hope that someone in the comments can talk about their experiences with social isolation too. But the biggest thing is I have so much time. To really consider myself and to really figure things out. And that's a good thing. Right. Because I can really kind of understand what is for me and what isn't. Right. And who is for me and who isn't. And when you have the silence of no social relationships or little to none. Right. You you get the whisper you get the through the grape from the through the grapevine effect where you can kind of hear underneath everything. What people will late and we think about you. Right. Because you don't have all these other people saying directly to you what's going on in their life or seating you with with ideas that they have about you. Right. You can I can just sit for a long time and sort of hear underneath everything. What is going on. And I have kind of an observational perspective to where I can kind of observe things. Right. The negative is I am now extremely socially like retarded for lack of a better term. Like I am very socially backwards right now because of the fact that I haven't. I haven't really interacted with people in a long time. Right. At least consistently. Right. Maybe one off here and there. And I'm so excited to hang out with someone that I feel like I'm off putting. So yeah, I just think that like you how do I put this. I think you have to think I have to just put myself into more social situations to where I can interact with people more. But that's hard to do. It's hard to do because I don't I don't really get along with a lot of people. And a lot of people get on my nerves. Um, so it's just kind of tough finding valuable social relationships in a world where it's like everyone's kind of inundated with content. And it just everything's kind of awkward. And it kind of sucks. But what are you going to do. I just think that like being as isolated as I am. It's taught me a lot about people because I've been able to observe people quite a bit. And um. That gives me sort of a social super power once I get back into interacting with people frequently. But um. Yeah, it's tough. It's it's not something that is very easy. And I think that I don't wish. Serious social isolation onto anyone. Um, because it is something that is not easy. Yeah. But yeah, those are just some thoughts on social isolation.
